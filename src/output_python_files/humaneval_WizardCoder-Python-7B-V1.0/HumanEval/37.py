# Explanation:
# In the first example, the even indices are [1, 3] and the odd indices are [2], so the sorted even indices are [1, 2] and the odd indices are [3].
# In the second example, the even indices are [5, 3] and the odd indices are [6], so the sorted even indices are [3, 6] and the odd indices are [5, 4].
# In the third example, the even indices are [1, 3, 5] and the odd indices are [2, 4], so the sorted even indices are [1, 3, 5] and the odd indices are [2, 4].
# In the fourth example, the even indices are [1, 3, 5, 7] and the odd indices are [2, 4, 6], so the sorted even indices are [1, 3, 5, 7] and the odd indices are [2, 4, 6].
# In the fifth example, the even indices are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and the odd indices are [2, 4, 6, 8], so the sorted even indices are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and the odd indices are [2, 4, 6, 8].
# In the sixth example, the even indices are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] and the odd indices are [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
