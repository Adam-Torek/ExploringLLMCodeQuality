# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
# where n is the length of the input list

# This function iterates through the list once to create a new list with the non-divisible by 3 elements and then sorts it, and then appends the divisible by 3 elements to the end of the list.
# The space complexity is O(n) because we create a new list with the same length as the input list.
