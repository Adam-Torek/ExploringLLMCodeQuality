    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]

      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
