def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

    # Calculate the sum of the array
    sum_arr = sum(arr)

    # Calculate the sum of the first and last half of the array
    first_half_sum = sum(arr[:n//2])
    second_half_sum = sum(arr[n//2:])

    # Calculate the difference between the sums
    diff = abs(first_half_sum - second_half_sum)
