# CS 1.2 Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of computer science. We will cover the basic data structures and algorithms that underlie the design of modern software systems. We will learn how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and how to implement them in code. We will also learn how to use these data structures and algorithms to solve problems.

## What You Will Learn

* How to use the Python programming language to solve problems
* How to analyze the efficiency of algorithms
* How to implement algorithms in code
* How to use data structures and algorithms to solve problems

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
