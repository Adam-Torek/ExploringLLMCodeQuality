    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".

    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"

# Solution:
# We can solve this problem by iterating through the first list and checking if
# the current element is even. If it is, we can add it to a new list and remove
# it from the original list. We can then repeat this process for all the elements
# in the first list. If we reach the end of the first list without finding any
# even elements, we can return "NO". Otherwise, we can return "YES".
