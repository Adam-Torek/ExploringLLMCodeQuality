# Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

# Variables are created when you assign a value to it.

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
