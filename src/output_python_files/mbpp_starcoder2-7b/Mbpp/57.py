1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer
Easy

Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.

For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
Example 2:

Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
 

Note:

0 <= N < 10^9

1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
Medium

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= K <= A.length
A[i] is 0 or 1
