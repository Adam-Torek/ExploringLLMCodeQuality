In this kata, you must create a digital root function.

A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

Here's how it works (Ruby example given):

digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7

digital_root(942)
=> 9 + 4 + 2
