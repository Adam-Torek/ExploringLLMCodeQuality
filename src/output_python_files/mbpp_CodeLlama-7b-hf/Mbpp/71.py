    Comb sort is a sorting algorithm that is similar to bubble sort.
    It is a comparison sort, which means it only makes one pass through
    the list to be sorted.
    It is a stable sort, which means that the relative order of elements
    that are equal is preserved.
    It is an in-place sort, which means that the algorithm does not use
    any extra memory.
