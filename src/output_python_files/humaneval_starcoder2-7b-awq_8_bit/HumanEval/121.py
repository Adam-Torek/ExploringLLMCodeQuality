# ## 1.2.2. Exercise: List Comprehensions
#
# List comprehensions are a powerful way to create lists. They are a shorthand way to create lists.
#
# For example, the following code creates a list of the squares of the numbers 1 through 10:
#
# ```python
# squares = []
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     squares.append(i**2)
# ```
#
# The same list can be created using a list comprehension:
#
# ```python
# squares = [i**2 for i in range(1, 11)]
# ```
