List Comprehension

List comprehension is a way to create lists in Python.

The general syntax is:

new_list = [expression for item in list]

The expression can be any Python expression, including another list
comprehension.

For example:

new_list = [x for x in range(10)]

The above code creates a list of numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

The above code creates a list of squares of numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.

The above code creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9.
