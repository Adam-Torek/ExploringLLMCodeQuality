# CS 1.1: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of computer science. We will cover the basic concepts of data structures and algorithms, including their implementation and analysis. We will also cover the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, and inheritance.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Explain the difference between a data structure and an algorithm.
