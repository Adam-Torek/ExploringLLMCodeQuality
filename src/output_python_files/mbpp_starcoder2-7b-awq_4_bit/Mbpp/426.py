Variables

# Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a
# computer program.

# Variables are created when you assign a value to it.

# Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.
# The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

# The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

# Example
# Create a variable called "x" and assign it the value 5:

x = 5

# Now x will have the value 5

# Multiple variable assignments

# You can assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

# Output

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Note:
# Variable names are case-sensitive.

# Example
# Create two variables called "x" and "y" and assign them the values 5 and 10:

x = 5
y = 10

# Output

print(x)
print(y)

# Note:
# The value of a variable can be of any type:

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

# Note:
# Variable names are case-sensitive.

# Example
# Create two variables called "x" and "y" and assign them the values 5 and 10:

x = 5
y = 10

# Output

print(x)
print(y)

# The value of a variable can be of any type:

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
