Variables are used to store data.

Variables are declared using the equal sign (=).

Variables are case sensitive.

Variables can be declared with letters, numbers, and underscores.

Variables cannot start with a number.

Variables can be declared on one line.

Variables can be declared with the same name.

Variables can be declared with different data types.

The while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.

The while loop is also known as the "while loop".

The while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.

The while loop requires a test expression (condition) and a block of code.

The code block will be executed as long as the test expression (condition) evaluates to true.

The test expression is checked before each iteration.

The while loop will continue to execute as long as the test expression (condition) evaluates to true.

The while loop can be terminated with a break statement.

The while loop will not execute if the test expression is false.

The while loop can be terminated with a break statement.

The while loop can be terminated with a continue statement.
