Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i] consists of lowercase letters

Given an array A of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an i and replace A[i] with -A[i], and we repeat this process K times in total.  (We may choose the same index i multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

Example 1:

Input: A = [4,2,3], K = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose indices (1,) and A becomes [4,-2,3].
Example 2:

Input: A = [3,-1,0,2], K = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].
Example 3:

Input: A = [2, -3, -1, 5, -4], K = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].

/leetcode/easy/1007_minimum_domino_rotations_for_equal_row.py
"""
In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
Example 2:

Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation:
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dom
