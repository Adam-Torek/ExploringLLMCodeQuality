def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"

# Solution:
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    else:
        return str(round(sum(range(n, m+1)) / (m-n+1)))

# Test cases
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Output: "0b11010"<|endoftext|>
