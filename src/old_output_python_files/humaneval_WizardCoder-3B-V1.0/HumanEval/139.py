# Solution:
# We can use the formula for the factorial of a positive integer n as:
# n! = n * (n-1)!
# We can use this formula to calculate the factorial of a given integer n.
# We can then multiply this factorial by the factorial of n-1, n-2,..., 1.
# This will give us the special factorial of the given integer.
