    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.

# Solution:
# We can solve this problem by first checking if the two intervals intersect.
# If they don't intersect, then the length of the intersection is 0, which is not a prime number.
# If they intersect, then we can calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start of the first interval from the end of the second interval.
# If the length of the intersection is a prime number, then it is a prime number.
# If the length of the intersection is not a prime number, then it is not a prime number.

# Let's implement this solution in Python.
