# Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.

# Variables are created when you assign a value to it.

# Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.
# The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

# The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

# Python accepts multiple assignment.

# Python is a case sensitive language.

# Variable names are case sensitive.

# Variable names should be meaningful.

# Variable names should not start with a number.

# Variable names can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).

# Variable names cannot contain spaces.

# Variable names cannot contain special characters.

# Variable names cannot contain reserved words.
